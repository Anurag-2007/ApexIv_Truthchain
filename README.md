## 📖 Overview

**TruthChain** is a decentralized truth-detection platform designed to solve the problem of digital revisionism. 

In the Web2 world, news headlines and historical records can be quietly edited, censored, or deleted by centralized authorities. In the age of AI-generated misinformation, we lack a permanent baseline for verified information.

TruthChain uses the **Ethereum Blockchain** as an immutable "Time Machine." Once a news event is published to our smart contract, it is mathematically locked forever. It cannot be edited, deleted, or tampered with—creating a trustless, verifiable history for the future.

## 💡 The Problem vs. The Solution

| The Old Way (Web2) | The TruthChain Way (Web3) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mutable:** Admins can edit articles after publishing. | **Immutable:** Once on-chain, it is "Digital Stone." |
| **Censorable:** Platforms can de-platform topics. | **Unstoppable:** The network is decentralized. |
| **Unknown Origin:** Hard to verify the source or time. | **Proof of Existence:** Cryptographic timestamps verify exactly *when* and *who* published it. |

## 🚀 Features

* **Wallet Connection:** Users connect via MetaMask to authenticate without centralized servers.
* **Immutable Publishing:** Writers can publish headlines and content that are permanently stored on the blockchain.
* **Decentralized Storage:** Data is not hosted on a single database that can be wiped; it lives on the distributed ledger.
* **Live Verification:** Readers can view the transaction hash to verify the authenticity of the news item themselves.
